// Installation Guide for ATS/Anairiats

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# Installation from a precompiled package
#
######

In order to use installation approach, which is the simplest, you are
required to have root access. After downloading an approriate precompiled
ATS package for your platform, please untar it in the root directory "/".
Then set the environment variable ATSHOME to "/usr/share/atshome".

# Installation through source code compilation
#
######

The current implementation of ATS is given the name ATS/Anairiats, or
simply Anairiats. It is nearly all written in ATS itself. In order to
install Anairiats, the following requirements need to be met:

  * Operating System requirement:

    * Linux
    * Windows with Cygwin
    * MacOS X (currently no GC support for multithreading)
    * SunOS (currently no GC support for multithreading)

    We plan to port it to other platforms in the future.

  * Programming Language requirement: GNU C Compiler (GCC).

Also, the GMP library (libgmp.a), which is often included in a GNU/Linux
distribution, is currently optional, and it may be required to install a
future release of ATS.

Once these requirements are met, you can readily install Anairiats in 3
steps as describled below:

Step 1: After downloading the tarball ATS.tgz, please untar it in a
directory, say "FOO", of your choice. This, for instance, can be done
by executing the following command:

tar -zvxf ATS.tar.gz 

All the files and directories extracted from the tarball are now in
the directory "FOO/ATS".

Step 2: Please set the shell environment variable ATSHOME to be
"FOO/ATS". For instance, this can be done by executing the following
command in BASH:

ATSHOME=FOO/ATS; export ATSHOME

or the following command in CSH/TCSH:

setenv ATSHOME FOO/ATS

You may want to put this command in a file (e.g., .cshrc or .bashrc)
that is executed each time when a shell is started.

Step 3: You can now go into the directory "FOO/ATS" and execute

make all

This generates executables "atscc" and "atsopt" in the directory
"FOO/ATS/bin", which is the command you need for compiling ATS programs,
and a library file "libats.a" in the directory "FOO/ATS/CCOMP/lib", which
you need for linking.

Step 4: Lastly, you need to create symbolic links to "atscc" and "atsopt"
in a directory (e.g., "/usr/bin" if you have root access) that is on your
execution path, or you may simply put the directory "FOO/ATS/bin" on your
execution path, which can be done in BASH as follows:

PATH=${PATH}:${ATSHOME}/bin; export PATH

or in CSH/TCSH as follows:

setenv PATH ${PATH}:${ATSHOME}/bin

#
# Installation through bootstrapping 
#
######

Prerequisite: [byacc] is needed for bootstrapping.

In order to bootstrap ATS/Anairiats, one needs to first check out the
following svn directory and name it as some local directory, say, "FOO":

svn co https://ats-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ats-lang/trunk FOO

Then one needs to check out another svn directory and name it as the local
directory "FOO/bootstrap0":

svn co \
  https://ats-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ats-lang/bootstrap/anairiats-x.x.x \
  FOO/bootstrap0

Note that "x.x.x" should be replaced with the latest version number
available for bootstrapping, which currently is "0.1.0". After this is
done, please go into the directory "FOO" and execute the command 'autoconf'
and then do 'make all'.

It is also possible to use the ATS/Geizella compiler (written in Objective
Caml) for bootstrapping ATS/Anairiats. This can be done by checking out the
following svn directory and name it as the local directory
"FOO/bootstrap0":

svn co \
  https://ats-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ats-lang/bootstrap/geizella-x.x.x \
  FOO/bootstrap0

Note that "x.x.x" should be replaced with the latest version number
available for bootstrapping, which currently is "0.1.0". After this is
done, please go into the directory "FOO" and execute the command 'autoconf'
and then do 'make all'.
