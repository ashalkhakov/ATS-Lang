HX:

The code in each LazyFoo-lesson?? directory is, more or less, a translation
into ATS the corresponding tutorial code (in C++) that is available at the
following site:

http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials

I did the translation in January, 2010. If changes are to be made to the
original C++ code in the future, I may not update the translation.
