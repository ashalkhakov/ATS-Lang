######

So far, both x86-32 and mips are targeted.

######

tiger_main: the main function is implemented here

######

error: for handling errors during compilation

######

stamp: for generating and manipulating stamps

######

symbol: for symbol manipulation

######

types: for handling types during typechecking

######

absyn: abstract syntax trees for Tiger

######

fixity: for resolving the issue of fixity (prefix, infix and postfix)

######

parser:

A parser for Tiger that is built with parsing combinators.

######

interp0:

An interpreter for Tiger; it should be called on a Tiger program after the
program passes typechecking

######

tychecker:

A typechecker for Tiger; it also does escape analysis on local variables.

######

irtree: a tree langauge for intermediate representation

######

translate:

for translating a tiger programing into the tree language introduced for
intermediate representation.

######

canonical:

for puting the tree expression returned after translation into some
canonical form

######

interp1:

An interpreter for the tree language in Tiger; it is mainly for testing the
code obtained after canonicalization.

######

codegen:

for performing instruction selection.

codegen_x86_32:

for performing instruction selection on the 32-bit x86 arch; this one is functioning

codegen_mips:

for performing instruction selection on the mips arch; this one is not yet functioning

######

tempset:

for representing and processing sets of temporary registers; this one currently uses
(unrealistic) list represention for sets.

######

fgraph:

for representing and processing flow graphs

######

liveness:

for permforming liveness analysis that yields inteference graphs

######

igraph:

for representing and processing interference graphs

######

regalloc:

for performing register allocation.
