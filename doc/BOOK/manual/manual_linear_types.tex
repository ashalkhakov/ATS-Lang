\chapter{Programming with Linear Types}

The paradigm of programming with theorem proving plays an indispensable
role in making linear types available for practical use in ATS.  In this
chapter, we present some examples of resource manipulation involving linear
types. In particular, we demonstrate that ATS not only supports flexible
uses of pointers but can also guarantee based on its type system that such
uses are safe.

\section{Safe Memory Access through Pointers}
In ATS, a linear prop is referred to as a {\it view} and a linear type,
which is often a type combined with a view, is referred to as a {\it
viewtype}. A commonly used view constructor is $@$ (infix), which forms a
view $T@L$ when applied to a type $T$ and a memory location $L$. If a proof
of the view $T@L$ is available, then it is guaranteed that a value of the
type $T$ is stored at the location $L$. In the following presentation,
views of the form $T@L$ is often referred to as @-views.  As an example,
the following function templates {\it ptr\_get0} and {\it ptr\_set0}, which reads
and writes through a given pointer, are assigned types containing @-views:
\begin{verbatim}
fun{a:t@ype} ptr_get0 {l:addr} (pf: a @ l | p: ptr l): @(a @ l | a)
fun{a:t@ype} ptr_set0 {l:addr} (pf: a? @ l | p: ptr l, x: a): @(a @ l | void)
\end{verbatim}
Note that $\tptr$ is a type constructor that forms a type $\tptr(L)$ when
applied to a static term $L$ of the sort {\it addr}, and the only value of
the type $\tptr(L)$ is the pointer that points to the location represented
by $L$.

Given a type $T$, the function ${\it ptr\_get0}\langle
T\rangle$ is assigned the following type:
\[\forall l:\saddr.~(T @ l \mid \tptr (l))\timp(T@l \mid T)\]
This type indicates that the function ${\it ptr\_get0}\langle T\rangle$
returns a proof of the view $T@L$ and a value of the type $T$ when applied
to a proof of the view $T@L$ and a pointer of the type $\tptr(L)$ for some
$L$. Intuitively, a proof of the view $T@L$, which is a form of resource as
$T@L$ is linear, is {\it consumed} when it is passed to ${\it
ptr\_get0}\langle T\rangle$, and another proof of the view $T@L$ is
generated as ${\it ptr\_get0}\langle T\rangle$ returns. Notice that a proof
of the view $T@L$ must be returned for otherwise subsequent accesses to the
memory location $L$ become impossible.

Similarly, the function ${\it ptr\_set0}\langle T\rangle$ is
assigned the following type:
\[\forall l:\saddr.~(T? @ l \mid \tptr (l))\timp(T@l \mid void)\]
Note that $T?$ is a type for values of size ${\it sizeof}(T)$.  The
function ${\it ptr\_set0}\langle T\rangle$ returns a proof of the view
$T@L$ when applied to a proof of the view $T?@L$, a pointer of the type
$\tptr(L)$ and a value of the type $T$. The use of the view $T?@L$
indicates that the memory location at $L$ is assumed to be uninitialized
when ${\it ptr\_set0}\langle T\rangle$ is called.

\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{figure:swap0_example.dats}, a function template {\it swap0}
is implemented for swapping memory contents at two given
locations. Compared to a corresponding implementation in C, the verbosity
of this one in ATS is evident. In particular, the need for {\it threading}
linear proofs through calls to functions that make use of resources often
results in a significant amount of code to be written. We now introduce
some special syntax to significantly alleviate the need for such code.

The function templates ${\it ptr\_get1}$ and ${\it ptr\_set1}$ are given
the following types:
\begin{verbatim}
fun{a:t@ype} ptr_get1 {l:addr} (pf: !a @ l >> a @ l | p: ptr l): a
fun{a:t@ype} ptr_set1 {l:addr} (pf: !a? @ l >> a @ l | p: ptr l, x: a): void
\end{verbatim}
Given a type $T$, the function
${\it ptr\_get1}\langle T\rangle$ is assigned the following type:
\[
\forall l:\saddr.~(!T@l \gg T@l \mid \tptr(l))\timp T
\]
Given a linear proof ${\it pf}$ of the view $T@L$ for some $L$ and a
pointer $p$ of the type $\tptr(L)$, the function call ${\it
ptr\_get1}\langle T\rangle({\it pf}, p)$ is expected to return a
value of the type $T$. However, the proof ${\it pf}$ is not
consumed. Instead, it becomes a proof of the view $T@L$ after the function
call. Similarly, the function
${\it ptr\_set1}\langle T\rangle$ is assigned the following type:
\[
\forall l:\saddr.~(!T?@l \gg T@l \mid \tptr(l), T)\timp\tvoid
\]
Given a linear proof ${\it pf}$ of the view $T?@L$ for some $L$, a pointer
$p$ of the type $\tptr(L)$ and a value $x$ of the type $T$, the function
call ${\it ptr\_set1}\langle T\rangle({\it pf}, p, x)$ is expected to
return the void value while changing the view of ${\it pf}$ from $T?@L$ to
$T@L$.  In general, if $f$ is given a type of the following form for some
views $V_1$ and $V_2$: $$(\ldots,!V_1\gg V_2,\ldots)\timp\ldots$$ then a
function call $f(\ldots,{\it pf},\ldots)$ on some proof ${\it pf}$ of the
view $V_1$ is to change the view of ${\it pf}$ into $V_2$ upon its return.
In the case where $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the same, $!V_1\gg V_2$ can simply be
written as $!V_1$.

As an example, a function {\it swap1} for swapping the contents on two
given memory locations is implemented in
Figure~\ref{figure:swap1_example.dats},
where the functions ${\it ptr\_get1}$ and ${\it ptr\_set1}$ are employed.
