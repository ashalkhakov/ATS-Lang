Abstract:
The paper presents an approach to enriching the type system of ML with a
restricted form of dependent types, where type index terms are required to
be drawn from a given type index language #emph("L") that is completely
separate from run-time programs, leading to the #emph("DML(L)") language
schema.  This enrichment allows for specification and inference of
significantly more precise type information, facilitating program error
detection and compiler optimization.  The primary contribution of the paper
lies in a novel language design, which can effectively support the use of
dependent types in practical programming. In particular, this design makes
it both natural and straightforward to accommodate dependent types in the
presence of effects such as references and exceptions.

<h2>#uid("DTPterm", "Dependent Types for Program Termination Verification")

Abstract:
Program termination verification is a challenging research subject of
significant practical importance. While there is already a rich body of
literature on this subject, it is still undeniably a difficult task to
design a termination checker for a realistic programming language that
supports general recursion.  In this paper, we present an approach to
program termination verification that makes use of a form of dependent
types developed in Dependent ML (DML), demonstrating a novel application of
such dependent types to establishing a liveness property. We design a type
system that enables the programmer to supply metrics for verifying program
termination and prove that every well-typed program in this type system is
terminating.  We also provide realistic running examples to support the
effectiveness of this approach to program termination verification as well
as its unobtrusiveness to programming.

<h2>#uid("GRDTpaper", "Guarded Recursive Datatype Constructors")</h2>

<table>

<tr><td>
Abstract:
The paper introduces a notion of guarded recursive (g.r.) datatype
constructors, generalizing the notion of recursive datatypes in functional
programming languages such as ML and Haskell. Both theoretical and
practical issues resulted from this generalization are addressed. On one
hand, a type system is designed to formalize the notion of g.r. datatype
constructors and its soundness is proven. On the other hand, some
significant applications (e.g., implementing objects, implementing staged
computation, etc.) of g.r. datatype constructors are given, indicating that
g.r. datatype constructors can have far-reaching consequences in
programming.  The main contribution of the paper lies in the recognition
and then the formalization of a programming notion that is of both
theoretical interest and practical use.

<h2>#uid("ATSpaper",'Applied Type System')</h2>

<tr><td>
Abstract:
The framework Pure Type System (PTS) offers a simple and general approach
to designing and formalizing type systems. However, in the presence of
dependent types, there often exist some acute problems that make it
difficult for PTS to accommodate many common realistic programming features
such as general recursion, recursive types, effects (e.g., exceptions,
references, input/output), etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework
Applied Type System (ATS) to allow for designing and formalizing type
systems that can readily support common realistic programming features. The
key salient feature of ATS lies in a complete separation of statics, in
which types are formed and reasoned about, from dynamics, in which programs
are constructed and evaluated. With this separation, it is no longer
possible for a program to occur in a type as is otherwise allowed in PTS.
We outline a formal development of ATS, establishing various (meta)
properties of applied type systems. In addition, we provide some
examples taken from ATS, a programming language with its type system rooted
in ATS, to demonstrate the expressiveness and flexibility of ATS as a
framework for type system design and formalization in support of practical
programming.

<table>

<tr><td>
Abstract:
Applied Type System (ATS) is recently proposed as a framework for
designing and formalizing (advanced) type systems in support of practical
programming. In ATS, the definition of type equality involves a
constraint relation, which may or may not be algorithmically decidable.  To
support practical programming, we adopted a design in the past that imposes
certain restrictions on the syntactic form of constraints so that some
effective means can be found for solving constraints automatically.
Evidently, this is a rather <EM>ad hoc</EM> design in its nature.  In this
paper, we rectify the situation by presenting a fundamentally different
design, which we claim to be both novel and practical. Instead of imposing
syntactical restrictions on constraints, we provide a means for the
programmer to construct proofs that attest to the validity of
constraints. In particular, we are to accommodate a programming paradigm
that enables the programmer to combine programming with theorem proving.
Also we present some concrete examples in support of the practicality of
this design.
